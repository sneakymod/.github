# 📝 About
SneakyMod is a modloader for Sneaky Sasquatch. This allows custom content to be added to the game.

# 📂 Download
sneakyLoader and sneakyPatcher are not ready to be released. Please be patient.

# 🤝 Contributing
Because this project is in its infancy, unless invited you probably will not be able to help.
We do not want to risk RAC7's IP.
We will do our best to document the game's source without revealing the code itself.

# ❓ FAQ
**WHY NO RELEASE YET???**
`We are a team of hobbyists, meaning we are doing this in our own free time because we feel like it. We don't owe a mod loader to the community. Please have some patience.`

**Can I help?**
`If you're experienced at C# or you think in you can help in other ways, feel free to create a GitHub issue.`

**Wait, so what will this mod do?**
`SneakyMod is a mod loader, not an actual mod. We will have mods available for download when the launcher releases however.`

**I have an idea for a mod/I want to create a mod**
`Great! If you want to create a mod, our SDK for mod development will be available SOON™.`
